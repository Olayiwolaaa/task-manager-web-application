4. **Task Status:** Provide options to mark tasks as completed, pending, or in progress.
5. **Search and Filter:** Implement search and filter functionalities to easily find tasks based on keywords, categories, status, etc.
6. **Reminders:** Allow users to set reminders for tasks with notifications.
7. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on various devices and screen sizes.
8. **Data Persistence:** Use a database to persist user accounts and tasks. You can use SQLite for simplicity or more robust solutions like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
9. **API Backend (Optional):** Implement a RESTful API backend using Python (Django or Flask) or Node.js (Express) for handling CRUD operations and authentication.
10. **Frontend Framework:** Use a frontend framework like React.js (JavaScript/TypeScript) or Vue.js to build the user interface.
11. **Version Control:** Host the project on GitHub for version control and collaboration with other developers.
12. **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application locally.
